P (k heads in n trials) = (n, k) p^k (1-p)^(n-k)

Frequentist inference would maximize the above to arrive at an estimate of p = k / n.

Bayesian would say: Hey, I know that p ~ Beta(1,1) (which is equivalent to assuming that p is uniform on [0,1]). So, the updated inference would be:

p ~ Beta(1+k,1+n-k) and thus the bayesian estimate of p would be

In the one case (the one i think of being meant by CLT) you draw samples from one distribution. Their means are normally distributed.

Thanks for the tip on BFAST - it looks very promising for my purpose! As I briefly mentioned, in my case the rolling aggregation doesn't actually remove the seasonality (there are slacks and surges in effort on a more-or-less predictable schedule, coupled with turnover in the measure denominator), and I have noticed that even with a lag(12) in my breakpoints() model specification, strucchange is a little more sensitive to these seasonal spikes than I'd prefer.",2010-08-09T17:46:42.490,394,CC BY-SA 2.5,

I can see how such a model might provide a more precise model of observed responses. However, in the typical practical research situations that I have seen, researchers are interested in whether the two groups differ in terms of the mean (e.g., did the training group report greater performance than the control; was student satisfaction higher one year to the next).

2) Indep., same var. Usual ANOVA assumption. Estimate SEs using pooled RSS. Estimate is more robust IF assumptions correct.

Why can't we use a single threshold for the entire points, I mean, if we did enough simulations we would get straight (read and yellow) lines.

5811,4024,0,"Thank you for suggestions. Logically, it is not quite possible to merge phenotypes as each of them is a unique combination of three recorded parameters. Since each of these parameters can go ""up"", ""down"" or stay ""unchanged"" as a result of a mutation, so there can be 3^3=27 distinct phenotypes. In the example above I removed those phenotypes for which both groups scored ""0"", so there were only 21 of them. I do see the prevalence of certain phenotypes but i would like to have some statistical proof that distributions of such phenotypes in various groups of mutants is similar (or not).

In the original paper, one of the parameters that is estimated is $\sigma_{a}$, the variance of the technology shock.

Instead, you must assign a prior to the standard error of the shock directly. Given that the prior of the variance is inverse gamma I assumed that a suitable prior for the stderr would be the ""square root"" of this invgamma distribution.

When n = 10^k, 90% of the p's equal 10^{-k} and their sum looks Poisson with expectation 0.9.  Another 9% equal 10^{1-k} and *their* sum looks Poisson (with the same expectation).

For every complex number $a$ such that $|a|<1$, the sum of $a^n$ from $n=0$ to $+\infty$ is $1/(1-a)$. For $a=1-p$, one gets $E(N)=1/p=27$.",2011-01-03T13:30:12.853,2592,CC BY-SA 2.5,

But if we substitute $Y_{t-1}=\rho Y_{t-2}+\varepsilon_{t-1}$ into the first equation and repeat the process indefinitely  we will get that $Y_t=\sum_{s=0}^{\infty} \rho^{s}\varepsilon_{t-s}$, so there is actually no systematic part according to the original definition.",2011-01-31T08:28:03.037,2116,CC BY-SA 2.5,

I am convinced that likely the MDS is not the right analysis, since my table
does not contain the distances. Indeed if you have a look to the diagonal of the
table you can see that the values are not 0 (which should express zero distance
between the same stimuli).
The values I have in my table are not distances but average scores from a 9 points
Likert scale, assessing the degree of coherence between two modalities (audio and
haptic) simulating different pairs of materials.

So my question now is: which analysis should I perform in your opinion?
