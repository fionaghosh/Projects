From there on my curiosity grew to become more about computers in general. I guess I grew up being a total geek. ;)</p>
<p>Later on I picked up QBasic then VB and ASP and from there I moved on to .NET first as a VB.NET developer but then my current job forced me to change to C# and I haven't looked back since.</p>

<p>40+ years programming everything. Virtual and shared online environments is my current focus. User-interface design and human-facing applications has been my main specialty for well over 30 years contributing core IP to several startups.
</p>
<p>
I have specific experience in 2D, 3D, VR and AR applications over a wide array of projects for several young startups dating back to days at MIT's Media Lab.
In the past, I've been involved with unique work utilizing Papervision, Alternativa, Torque and Unity. Most recently I've made many exploratory 3d environments with WebGL, and shared environment experiments built utilizing nodejs, a-frame, and reactjs also.
</p>
<p>
Today I am creating <b>Infinite Stores</b> - a spatial CMS platform and editing tools for making dynamic content-rich 3D and virtual reality shopping experiences.</p> 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OCbs2.jpg"">
<p><b>Infinite Stores</b> provides individuals as well as groups of artisans a new way to sell products online via virtual store-spaces within an endless shopping universe that they can maintain and visually merchandise - just like real-world stores. The layout and mgmt apps are super easy to use and run in any web browser and do not require any special equipment.

Because they are the same team. Toxic community of ungrateful inadequate people who censor me and delete my content just because I responsibly follow the official rules of SO that they don't follow. They are blatantly violating multiple SO rules, they are collectively stalking, downvoting and deleting random answers of mine just to show that nothing can stop them because they are moderators. Such behaviour isn't professional, it is disgusting and shameful. They are such mean people that even write insults on me in comments. When I flags insults the flags get ignored. No matter what is written in rules of SO they don't work because moderators are promoting different rules -- such that allow people to insult you in comments, calling you bad words, saying that you are handicapped and other things. Moderators refuse to remove such comments and if you create a post in Meta to highlight the problem, instead of acting and fixing it they only write even more insults on you -- the Meta website is a trap place where they call you to come to throw even more trash on you, publicly insult and demean you. Do not believe moderators -- they always lie and censor everything that would expose it.</h3>

<h1>Python 3 vs Raku</h1>
<h2>Python 3: Unordered common lines between two files:</h2>
<pre><code>#!/bin/env python

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Determine the lines in common between two files')

parser.add_argument('fileA', help='file name')
parser.add_argument('fileB', help='file name')

args = parser.parse_args()

with open(args.fileA) as x: linesA = x.readlines()
with open(args.fileB) as x: linesB = x.readlines()

intersection = set(linesA).intersection(set(linesB))

print(&quot;&quot;.join(sorted(intersection)))
</code></pre>
<p>Usage message resulting from <code>python intersection_of_lines.py --help</code>:</p>
<pre><code>usage: intersection_of_lines.py [-h] fileA fileB

Determine the lines in common between two files

positional arguments:
  fileA       file name
  fileB       file name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
</code></pre>
<h2>Raku: Unordered common lines between two files:</h2>
<pre><code>#!/bin/env raku

sub MAIN #= Determine the lines in common between two files
(   <span class=""math-container"">$fileA, #= file name
    $</span>fileB, #= file name
)
{
    my @linesA = <span class=""math-container"">$fileA.IO.lines;
    my @linesB = $</span>fileB.IO.lines;

    my $intersection = @linesA ∩ @linesB;

    put $intersection.keys.sort.join(&quot;\n&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yes that is <code>∩</code>, a real Unicode intersection symbol. The ASCII version <code>(&amp;)</code> also works.</p>
<p>You also get a nice usage message resulting from <code>raku intersection_of_lines.raku --help</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Usage:
  ./intersection_of_lines.raku &lt;fileA&gt; &lt;fileB&gt; -- Determine the lines in common between two files

    &lt;fileA&gt;    file name
    &lt;fileB&gt;    file name

<p>I love working on the hardest problems. My home is *nix and the command line. I enjoy the challenge of doing root-cause analysis on complex, distributed systems. I use an evidence-based approach to troubleshooting: I evaluate how available information might suggest behavior, then validate or disprove. I believe software engineering is all about communication.</p>

<p>I love uncovering relationships in data. More importantly, I work to understand the data generating process that creates the relationships, and I look for second-order effects of those relationships. Then I'm able synthesize complex relationships into a coherent story for non-technical audience, with an emphasis on business impact.</p>

<p>I'm interested in market microstructure, order management and execution, asset allocation, portfolio optimization, algorithmic trading systems, interest rate models, and high-performance computing.</p>

I'm a PhD student at the University of Arizona studying computer vision in the Department of Computer Science.  

</p><p>

I started programming at age 13 in Apple Hypercard (I still remember saving for months to buy version 2.2 -- with COLOR!).  I started learning C++ at 15, a process that I'm discovering never ends.  
</p><p>
I learned Java in college, and C# and SQL while interning at Intel.  After graduating, I spent around two years doing PHP development for the College of Fine Arts, and in Fall 2009, I began the PhD program, finally returning to my first love, C++, doing scientific computing.  Lately I've been experimenting with SWIG to incorporate Python into my C++ projects.
</p><p>
My PhD work has been primarily in machine learning and computer vision, using statistical models and Bayesian inference.  My current work focuses on reconstructing 3D structure of plants from 2D images.

Besides being a programmer, I'm also a music lover and amateur musician.",15,7,0,32848

<p>**About the avatar**:
<p>It is in memory of 2 of the greatest geniuses of the 20th century (or perhaps any century).  
<p>1. Peter Sellers whose comic genius inspired a whole slew of successful comedians and what better accomplishment to leave to the world than laughter!!
<p> 2.Stanley Kubrick whose films have been both iconoclastic and <b>profoundly humanistic</b> (I think some may have missed this point).  I believe his crowning achievement is in fact <b>Dr. Strangelove</b> who is pictured in the avatar.  A dark comedy (but with very serious overtones) about the ease with which the human species can eradicate itself.  If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it RIGHT NOW!

<p>I write most of my software in Java for a living and for fun.  I also enjoy programming in Python, Ruby, Javascript, and so on. I have used the Win16, Win32, and  Unix APIs at work - as well as dabbled in the pre-OSX Mac APIs too.</p>

<p>I find AI languages such as CLIPS, Prolog, and LISP adorable and precious - but that is just me.  I like SQL quite a lot, but it disappoints me that it has become such a catch-all for storing data.</p>

<p>I am a developer working primarily in .NET but also several other languages. I like to write scripts and automate as much as possible. I think it's incredibly important to want to continue learning throughout your career in order to improve.</p>
<p>I originally started professional software development using ASP.NET (webforms). I then switched jobs and worked almost exclusively in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coldfusion"">ColdFusion</a>. It gave me the chance to get to know MVC a lot more through the <a href=""https://github.com/Mach-II/Mach-II-Framework"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mach-II</a> framework - an implementation of MVC for Coldfusion. When ASP.NET MVC came out, convinced our employers to migrate due to a wider availability of software engineers (it was incredibly difficult to get good ColdFusion developers!). When it came to picking up ASP.NET MVC, I felt I had a much stronger advantage than if I had continued using 'classic' ASP.NET webforms.</p>
<p>I answered more questions in the first two months on here, than I did in five years at <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=experts+exchange+scam"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Experts Exchange</a>, and I enjoy the fact that stackoverflow is more community based.</p>
<p>Initially spurred on by the challenge of &quot;doing better than <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/261677/jonathon-bolster"">Jonathon Bolster</a>&quot;, I found that helping out is extremely enjoyable and helping people of all technical skill levels is great fun.</p>

<p>Just Another Genome Hacker,</p>
<p>Sadly, my most voted-up answer on Stackoverflow (311 votes) belonged to a question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2420689/surprise-for-a-programmer-on-birthday/2421312#2421312"">that later got deleted.</a> The question came from a girl that asked for something cute that she could put on the icing of a birthday cake for her programmer boyfriend.</p>
<p>I suggested that, if her boyfriend is somewhat mathematically inclined, she write the following:</p>
<pre><code>    sin(t) √|cos(t)|
r = __________________  - 2 sin(t) + 2
    sin(t) + 7/5
</code></pre>
<p>If he doesn't get it at first, she could tease him with saying that it is obvious that he should take the polar plot of it. If he still doesn't get it, she should tell him to enter it in <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar%20r=%28sin%28t%29*sqrt%28abs%28cos%28t%29%29%29%29/%28sin%28t%29%20%2b%207/5%29%20-2*sin%28t%29%20%2b%202"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WolframAlpha</a>, that should yield the result:</p>

<p>I'm a software developer/architect currently mainly working on industrial telemetry systems using a mix of Elixir, C++, and Python.</p>
<p>I've also spent a lot of my life working in Ruby (with and without Rails), C#, Java, and some more esoteric languages. I sometimes do technical program management and serve in a technical advisory capacity for projects involving AWS, ElasticSearch, cloud infrastructure, internationalization, and so on. I've been working in software professionally since 1997, so there's a good chance I've Seen It Before.</p>
<p>In previous lives, I've worked for Microsoft, Revenue Science (now Audience Science), Zillow, a travel company called Virtuoso, the Seattle Times, and a very strange financial/transportation conglomerate, and I've done software consulting in the pharmaceutical industry, apparel, e-commerce, and so on. I've also worked as a solutions engineer or solutions architect.</p>
<p>If you're interested in tracking down a reasonably competent Rails or ASP.net MVC developer and are located near Tokyo, Japan or don't mind me working mostly remotely, feel free to contact me. I'm open to regular travel outside of Japan if it makes things easier for the team.</p>
<p>I like to cook. I'm pretty good at it. Sometimes I post pictures of what I'm cooking and/or eating on <a href=""https://instagram.com/jasntru"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>Long ago, I left home and joined the <a href=""http://www.marines.mil/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">United States Marine Corps</a> where I was assigned the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of Basic Metal Worker (MOS 1316). I loved building things as a welder, but could not see myself doing this until I reached age 65.</p>
<p>After my Honorable Discharge in the early 1990s, I used my G.I. Bill to go to school and received my Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics four years later.</p>
<p>Using a love of computers since I played on a Commodore 64 at 10 years old and two (2) C++ electives that I had taken in school, I began working in the computer programming field.</p>
<p>The recession following ENRON in 2001 left me working at a remedial job for a little over two years while I brushed up on my skills at a local community college in SQL and first learned what the new .NET Framework was all about.</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of working as a Software Developer since 2003.</p>
<p>For a short while, I pulled in a little extra income by running a moonlighting business under the name <a href=""http://www.joeswelding.biz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Joe's Welding</a>. Dangerous working conditions and non-paying customers prompted me to sell my mobile welding equipment about the time my son was born.</p>
<p>Today, I am exclusively a Software Developer with C# being my language of choice. I also enjoy working with databases, and my preferred database environment is Microsoft's T-SQL.</p>

For some reason instead of getting NES or PS, i've got Sinclair ZX for New Year Eve and after a while I got really excited with what you can get, writing number lines of code.</p>

<p>I tried and played with a lot of stuff including prolog, lisp, c , turbo pascal, delphi, basic, bash, javascript, vb, vbscript</p>

<p>I truly love javascript and really like where is it moving last 5 years.</p>

<p>I'm working mainly on three platforms</p>

<ul>
<li>.net (c#, iis, asp.net, sql server, wcf etc)</li>
<li>MEAN stack (javascript, node.js, express.js, mongo, angular.js)</li>
<li>Python (flask, web.py)</li>
</ul>

<p>After trying and playing with number of client-side MV** frameworks, I stick with angular.js for now, waiting when polymer/platform became more stable.</p>

<p>However later I'm trying to step back from angular and do something similar to basecamp next approach, when again you render html on the server side.</p>

<p>Funny to say but I see later (polymer) like client side asp.net. </p>

<p>I've got MSPD .net 4.0 Web Developer certification (MCTS WCF 4.0, ADO.NET 4.0, ASP.NET 4.0)</p>

<p>My story with JS started with IE6 and client side calculators for totaling clients expenses on pre-print media, that was quite long time ago, when there was no AJAX buzz word.  I moved to jquery, RICO, prototype and back to jquery, and was using mostly it since version 1.2. Also I was using ASP.NET AJAX for almost 10 years and find it to be quite under-valued framework.</p>

<p>I'm collecting 30 lines or less javascript examples, feel free to add yours <a href=""http://30lines.info"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://30lines.info</a></p>

<p>Feel free to stalk my Internet name(s) if you wish - it's how I make most of my closest contacts these days. Just note that I don't really believe in social constructs when they get in the way of satisficing (or in the way of my goal of learning as much as possible).</p>
<p>Don't take anything I say/do too seriously.  A lot of the things I do (that may look weird/stupid on the outside) are the types of things that help me adjust my posterior probability of various things - especially low probability events.Sometimes I hit on a jackpot/very interesting idea. I'm kind of messy since it helps facilitate creative destruction.</p>
<p>I have <em>a lot</em> of respect for <em>all</em> of the sciences. Tactically, I'm developing heuristics for rationality, impartiality, anti-laziness, and creation+identification+searching for what's relevant+reliable. Strategically, I just want to learn everything.</p>
<p>A lot of my thought processes involve my creating new hypotheses and refuting them on my own. I still document the thought process since it's important and may be important for future &quot;true&quot; hypotheses.</p>

There are definitely better data scientists and programmers out there than me, but my training as a sociologist seems to have given me some unique capabilities as an analyst that you don't get when only seing ""data as data"".</p>

<p>I just handed in my master thesis in sociology, where I did network analys of job mobility on very large population-level datasets from the national statistics agency, ""Danmarks Statistik"". I use Stata and R, and like R very much, a big fan of the tidyverse, ggplot2 and dplyr especially, although it could use some improvement when doing parametric codewriting. I guess I'm an R intermediate I guess, having no other code experience except Stata. I've mastered the basics and am currently learning to use functions and the apply-family of functions. In a couple of weeks, I start as a data analyst at the Ministery for Children and Social Affairs*, which I'm very psyched about.</p>

<p>In my spare time I play my guitar, do yoga, (trying to) meditate and hang out with my friends drinking beers and stuff like that. I love to hitchhike and be in nature!</p>

(Contact me at dc at qqtrend dot com: please mention you are coming from StackOverflow, so I know it is not spam.)</p>

<p>My first book was ""Data Push Apps with HTML5 SSE"", with O'Reilly, 2014 (ISBN: 978-1449371937). Old by computer standards, but the standard has been stable, so surprisingly still useful. My second book, at the end of 2016, also with O'Reilly, was Practical Machine Learning with H2O (ISBN: 978-1491964606).</p>

<p>I'm British, speak English and Japanese (fairly fluent, 1 kyu), with a bit of German, Chinese and Arabic. As for computer languages, I've done commercial work in most of them; but it has been mostly JavaScript, R, Python, C++ the past five years.</p>

I started programming when I was 10 after seeing SHRDLU on television... watching a robotic arm understand and correctly react to the command “Pick up a big red block” is a moment forever burned in my memory. Not long after that I played Intellivision at my cousin Matt’s house which occupied countless hours of my youth. I was never satisfied with simply playing the games, I wanted to know what was going on behind the scenes. At the same time my parents gave me my first computer: a TI99/4A, and my passion for creating software took root. The first program I wrote was not ""Hello World"", it was a chatter bot. I coded many games on that machine, including a Wizardry clone, which I would trade (via audio cassettes) with my like minded schoolmates.</p>

<p>Since then I've worked for a Fortune 500 company (AutoZone), an iconic American company (Yankee Candle), an indie game company making games for the blind (All inPlay), and I even took a stab at my company creating artificial intelligence tools and educational software. </p>

<p>I've been coding for almost 30 years - most of it professionally - and I love that I ""work"" in a profession where every day I learn something new and have the potential to change lives, heck, there are a couple marriages and even kids that resulted from some of my work at All inPlay.</p>

Well, let's say starting then I always tried to expand my knowledge. While I still am not a typical wizard at some topic, I believe I have collected a fair amount of knowledge over various areas. </p>

<p>These includes all of the three major desktop operating systems being used those days (with Windows being the least favored one and all Linux distributions counted as one single systems), as well as quite a lot of programming languages. </p>

<p>In my later years I decided to study mathematics, which helped me to sharpen my logical reasoning and develop a toolset of problem solving methods.</p>

<p>In 2011 I finished my M. Sc. in Maths and started working as a data- and process analyst at one of Germany's major companies. </p>

<p>In parallel I am working part-time on my PhD, researching one practical application for B-Splines and the methods that can be used for that. </p>

<p>Right now the languages and applications I use frequently are MATLAB, R and C++, as well as LaTeX, if one wants to call that a programming language (well, it's Turing-complete, isn't it?). Furthermore, I started getting used to Emacs and loving it - here, though, I'm only scratching on the surface.</p>

<p>now instead of having an input image synthesize output audio write a new golang server route callback to implement the reverse of above algorithm ... namely send this second route input audio and it wil synthesize an output image</p>
<p>when I was able to tie the above two processes together such that the audioA output of first algo was used as input audioB of second algo and the output imageB matched the original input imageA  ... I knew the system worked ...  I have this all working ... next step is to productionize ( speed up to become real time to handle 20 images per second ( streaming input video )  this and make available to the blind ( it may allow the blind to see with their ears ) ... and visa versa for the deaf ... also looking into other uses</p>
<p>Above was a recent fun side passion project ... I also write servers and server side processing as well as DevOps ...</p>
<p>Initially built a nodejs/mongo RESTful server, created a testing harness ... whipped together an encrypted email server using postfix ... then from scratch did everything to run the 5 container app in the cloud Google and AWS ... wrote DevOps code to synthesize templated configs for kubernetes, nginx, meteor/nodejs ... did all the TLS certs setup for nginx ... basically everything other than UI side</p>
<p>in golang wrote a SMTP parser content filter which gets launched by a postfix server to read incoming email traffic and persist portions of the email body and to handle arbitrary attachments</p>
<p>in golang wrote a log file parser which identifies error conditions to trigger alarms</p>
<p>wrote the orchestration code in bash to scale up/down aws instances for some flavors of our containers ... used the aws golang SDK to parse our instances, security groups etc. to synthesize the scale up/down ... avoided using aws cloud formation so we remain as vendor neutral as possible</p>
<p>in 4 days using golang wrote a resource usage monitor and visualization system to plot real time CPU/ram</p>

This blend of research and development is the type of work which motivates and excites me the most. Currently, I am working on <a href=""https://carp.cachet.dk/core/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a distributed platform which enables researchers to conduct biometric research</a> 'in the wild' (outside of the lab environment).</p>
<p>As part of my previous research, I developed a fully functional system (called <a href=""http://whatheco.de/laevo/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Laevo</a>), exploring an alternative to the prevalent, antiquated, desktop computing paradigm. This work (and related publications) contributes to a line of research called 'activity-centric computing'.</p>
<p>I have over 10 years of professional software development experience. Prior to academia, I worked for several years as a professional full-stack software developer at a game development company in Belgium: <a href=""http://www.aimproductions.be/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AIM Productions</a>. I immediately started working here after a successful internship concluding my bachelor degree in 2007. My job entailed working on interactive hometrainer software and other multimedia applications. This spiked my interest in user interface development. I liked the work and colleagues at the company too much to give up entirely for further studies, so I decided to combine the two. In 2009 I started studying for my master in Game and Media Technology at the <a href=""https://www.uu.nl/en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">University of Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands, from which I graduated in 2012.</p>

This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

simple hand-waving about light from the sun passing through our
planet's atmosphere. For a value of why + 2 (also known to parents as,

<p>===</p>

<p>When people asked me what I wanted to do for work 10 years ago, I did not know too well, so I just said <strong>""Something to do with computers""</strong>.</p>

<p>As I look at the last 10 years, I see that I did quite a lot of work all kinds of computers. From fiddling with microcontrollers and assembler code to writing data processing scripts to physically assembling computer consoles.</p>

<p>The big step forward came when I <strong>learned to think about software in a structured, object-oriented way</strong>, as this allowed me to make software do things that I want it to do. Right now I'm <strong>proficient in two high level programming languages</strong> - Objective-C and Java and have touched just about every framework available for iOS. I've also became a hacker/maker and have completed a number of projects involving software and hardware.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in my early 30s and when I ask myself <strong>""What would I like to do in the next 10 years?""</strong>, my answer is ""something with the human brain"". The seeds are already there - I've picked up an interest in biology, cognitive science and neuroscience, enough to converse with real people. I've done first-hand research into sleep and made discoveries. I've taken classes in synthetic biology, performing manipulations on the bacteria genome. I've learned a lot about the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain, as well as how a biological organism develops.</p>

<p>It seems like there are a lot of similarities between the object-oriented concepts I use in the daily programming tasks and how biological organisms operate. This makes me hopeful that by the time I'm in my late 30s, I would be able to work and program some form of biological computer or just plain hack the human brain.</p>

7290,142598,2011-11-09T04:43:15.613,gung - Reinstate Monica,2023-12-02T19:43:16.160,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongsun_Long,Kingdom of Zhao,"<p>Stack Exchange's actions have been reprehensible.  Monica Cellio, a popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator, <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193"">was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133/187282"">portrayed to the press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow, Inc. All signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not founded on fact, for which the company is completely failing to take any responsibility. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/187282"">This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in the community.</a></p>

<p>Monica and the community quite literally <strong>begged</strong> for <em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more than a month now. She made many good-faith offers to talk, and others offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Members of the Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/333992/187282"">1</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731/187282"">2</a>).</p>

<p>Stack Overflow, Inc. met all of this with thunderous silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate callousness of this behavior which we have to assume now is the new normal.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526/187282"">Having exhausted all other means of communication</a>, Monica began raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name.  This process ended with some form of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/340906/187282"">legal agreement</a> that entailed a non-disclosure agreement.  The NDA means that nothing else about the agreement is known.  What can be seen from the outside is that SE offered another lawyer-written non-apology, and issued a statement out of both sides of its mouth to <em>The Register</em> reiterating, falsely, that she did something wrong, but that she isn't really a bad person. We can also see that she was not reinstated.  This episode in the drama is over.  I trust the funds left over will go donated to <a href=""https://www.thetrevorproject.org/about/programs-services/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Trevor Project</a>, an organization that provides crisis-intervention services to LGBTQ+ youth. </p>

<p>Monica is an exemplar of the community, it's incredible how she's managed to keep a level head during this time when emotions have been very high.  She should be <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/336526/187282"">reinstated now</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Key issues such as <strong>duplicates are still not resolved</strong>. Measures like <em>not allowing</em> to post duplicates are not implemented; nor a recommender that helps users choose the most appropriate site, or ask better questions. This puts the burden on the frequent users and moderators to keep the site useful. At the same time, duplicates and low-quality questions do cause rude comments and answers in the first place. Solving this properly <em>would</em> likely make the tone much nicer.</li>
<li>Migration of questions is a complicated procedure, rather than simply making the different sites ""views"" on the same underlying data. There is a random set of migrations that can be proposed (such as SO to stats.SE), but no way to propose others (e.g., to DS.SE) They are making our lives harder than necessary.</li>
<li>We can't flag duplicates of questions on other SE sites, even if there is a perfect duplicate.</li>
<li>The company wastes tons of money on stupid things such as WinterBash, and on projects doomed to fail such as ""SO Documentation"" and ""SO for Teams"". I understand that you need to generate more revenue, but you should listen to your users (in particular to avoid <em>costly</em> failures such as documentation).</li>
<li><strong>The company does not listen to their users.</strong> A recent example is the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/340906/update-an-agreement-with-monica-cellio"">Monica incident</a>. This lawyeresque statement shows what is wrong: they fight their best users. But there are many more examples. ""User surveys"" that sound like they come from the sales department, not from user support; that avoid any of the big issues such as duplicates, low quality questions, and the resulting sometimes rude handling of such questions; and many more.</li>
<li>I do want to emphasize that I am in general <strong>in favor of a ""code of conduct""</strong>, and I do strongly believe we need to fight for diversity. I am all in favor of using stated pronouns, but I know that I would get them wrong often. I have not seen any of the transcripts, so I have no idea what Monica did, but we also all have heard of false accusations, mistakes, and so on. I do not think the situation was handled well by SO staff, and it only got worse and worse. A code of conduct that are community standards should actually come from the community, and be handled by the community, not by some higher entity like the company.</li>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-forced-relicensing-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in-cooper"">Firing mods and forced relicensing: is Stack Exchange still interested in cooperating with the community?</a></li>

I've had 30 years programming experience, the last 20 of which have been almost exclusively C++. I prefer to spend my idle time anywhere than on internet forums, so I only come here when I have unusual or perplexing questions. But that leads to a low reputation, and perhaps people assume that means I'm a novice, or don't understand the basics. The reality is I usually find myself asking questions from a viewpoint of ""this doesn't make sense - something is missing - there is this factor and that factor and another factor... and yet those are the trees, and I can't see the forest for them."" And then I roll my eyes in despair when people give me answers about trees, and wonder whether SO is worth the pain of trying to pose questions about forests.</p>

After a few years of shovelbumming, he found himself in Milwaukee, with weak prospects.  After conning his way into a statistics job, and realizing that the people asking him for advice knew even less than he did about numbers, he decided to do the normal thing, and actually return to school, earning his M.S. from the U of Minnesota's School of Public Health's Division of Biostatistics in 2005.</p>

Kevin is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston in the Levental Lab. His work has contributed to the understanding of the dynamic nature of lipids and proteins in cellular membranes and how dynamic changes in sections of the cell membrane regulate cellular activity and contribute to disease states.</p>

<p>Prior to joining the Levental Lab, Kevin received his Ph.D. at the University of Houston (UH) in Biology. His research focused on genome evolution, population genetics of copy number variation, and eukaryotic parasitism. His work involved bench laboratory work as well as programming computer simulations and advanced statistical analysis of large data sets.  He was involved with many student activities at UH, including acting treasurer and sports coordinator for the BioScience Graduate Society, founding member and treasurer of Students for Personal Safety, and mentoring undergraduate students in independent research.

<hr>

<p>I engineer software technology &amp; processes to solve human problems, grow businesses, and build strong teams. My teams maximize delivered quality and value for our stakeholders.</p>

<p>Working for companies ranging in size from startups to Google, myself and my teams have delivered solid engineering and quality-tested code. I am a proven engineering manager who inspires engineers and product contributors to push the envelope, and a team-leader who keeps teams engaged and productive.</p>

<p>My experience covers the full gamut of product definition and delivery. I have written quality code, built solid code-review and deployment pipelines, started from-scratch &amp; rescued legacy codebases. With executive teams and clients I have defined products, negotiated budgets &amp; schedules, and engineered to awe customers. As a manager I work to lead my teams in ways that respect their abilities and inspire them to work in the business' best-interests. I have successfully challenged teams to develop new skillsets and recruited for rare skills and can shape team-dynamics for long-term, learning-focused performance.</p>

<p>Specific skills include: Polyglot programming abilities (node.js, golang, React.js, Ruby, Java, python &amp; PHP), enterprise software integration with custom systems (Oracle CRM/Fusion accounting, Saleforce, SOAP/REST APIs, and multiple CMS platforms), Spark/Hadoop/Kafka/HBase/Airflow data pipelines, broad framework &amp; microservice development implementations, legacy codebase rescue, and engineer-driven code review through continuous deployment/intergration processes.</p>

At bbcom, I'd spent a lot of time moving an older monolith onto a ""multiple service"" style cloud deployment in AWS. Before that, I'd developed software-style web service applications to be installed within customer environments at Perforce.</p>

<p>In terms of tooling, I've used a lot of Java, but really enjoy using Kotlin, and am optimistic about it's adoption. For frameworks, I've employed the Spring framework largely, with additional tools like Hystrix and RxJava. The most recent data tools I've used are MySQL, a bit of Mongo and Redis, though I still appreciate PostgreSQL.</p>

I lead a team of extraordinary data scientists and engineers who are developing data-driven monetization strategies for LinkedIn's product suite and contributing to our IP portfolio through research. Some of our projects include the development of reserve prices for ads sold through the auction, estimation of survival-based lifetime value of subscribing members, development of forecasting algorithms, and identification and development of improvements to job recommendations in key segments. Prior to LinkedIn, I spent 5+ years as a Quantitative Manager (Research) at Google. There, I led research in search advertising effectiveness and developed machine learning models to help improve the targeting of Google's ads products and sales offerings. Some of our work was featured in the letter to board of directors and our research on search advertising has been featured in Techcrunch, Search Engine Land, and various media outlets. I continue to be active in the research community by publishing regularly and by serving as referee / editorial committee member for several journals (Engineering Optimization, Journal of Advertising Research, International Journal of Production Research, etc.). I hold a PhD from Northwestern University, a M.S. from University of Illinois, and a B.E from National Institute Of Technology (Karnataka, India).</p>

<p>I'm a Computer Science student. I like all things computery, but am especially interested in Ruby (+Rails), Javascript, AI and NLP. I enjoy hacking, making anything web-related and have written a couple of iPhone apps.</p>

<p>Other things I like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Music, especially the organ!</li>
<li>Languages: I can speak quite a bit of German and I'm a beginner in Spanish. I have a slight obsession with <a href=""http://www.duolingo.com/lexy0202"" rel=""nofollow"">Duolingo</a></li>

As one of two on the small startup's Reporting &amp; DevOps team, I both handle operational concerns and on-call work as well as create new features like our recent self-serve reporting project.</p>
<p>On the side, I'm an adjunct instructor in the computer science programs at Loyola Univ. New Orleans and a Data Scientist &amp; Software Architect with Kitchology. I also co-organize Code for New Orleans, our local Code for America brigade.</p>
<p>Prior to Healthify, I was on TED's Digital Products Team, where I built processing pipelines and products for TED's web presences and for the organization's internal tools and reporting. I spent about two years on the Analytics Squad, after which I worked in the Video Squad. A few highlights from that work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built a user recommendations API that serves recommendations for over 10 million subscribed users</li>
<li>Built and maintain the open source <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tedconf/fessonia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">@tedconf/fessonia Node.js library</a> for integrating FFmpeg</li>
<li>Built an automated, dockerized encoding process that integrates with our media asset management software</li>
</ul>
<p>Before TED, I worked in the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget as an IT Project Manager on the MAX.gov team. Before OMB, I worked at Social Security on policy analysis; OpenGov; agency vision, strategy &amp; innovation; and health IT initiatives. Prior, I worked at BAE Systems building signal processing software for underground imaging.</p>
<p>Until June 2014, I was a doctoral candidate (all-but-dissertation) in the Applied Mathematics &amp; Scientific Computation program in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland. My dissertation work focused on applying computational harmonic analysis and dimensionality reduction methods for large data to federal budget, political and economic data to understand the drivers of budget process health as measured by level of contention and ability to produce products within deadlines. My doctoral work was done under the supervision of the late Professor Dennis M. Healy, Jr. (d. 2009), and Professor Wojtek Czaja. I completed my master's degree in the same field in 2007 focusing on the mathematics of digital signal processing under Dr. Healy.</p>
<p>As you may see from my various online profiles, I have considerable experience in software and algorithmic development, as well as significant classroom experience with mathematics related to computing, signal processing and data reduction. I am interested in applying this knowledge to difficult problems involving the processing of large data, both numerical and textual. I have experience in business communications, business process analysis, information technology solutions for business problems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I used to work as a fraud analyst for an e-commerce company.<br>
Now I work doing infosec datageekery for a very large retailer.   </p></li>
<li><p>This means I spend a lot of time building and using tools that crunch data.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not a coder, but I do a fair chunk of coding.</p></li>
<li>I'm not a statistician, but I end up doing a lot of stats work at times.</li>
<li>I'm not a data scientist, but I have to build and use data tools.  </li>
<li>I'm not a detective, but I have to hunt down and stop bad guys.  </li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of my job is hunting down and slaying black swans.<br>
Making sure the improbable becomes visible and mitigated is kind of what I do.</p>

<p>My last degree was in Rhetoric and Political Communications.<br>
The one I'm working on currently is in Applied Math.<br>
After that, it's a Master's in Stats.<br>
Then I'm done. I promise.  Until the next really cool Coursera class comes up.  </p>

<p>I do (or have done, possibly a while back) work in Perl, Python, R, C, 6502 Assembler, and Javascript.<br>
My weapon of choice lately has been R. I'm always surprised how much you can do in R.<br>
Next up is Julia.  </p>

<p>The last really fun nerd thing I did was build a Hadoop cluster out of Raspberry Pi's.<br>
Just in case I need to tackle the ""Airline"" dataset at home. Using Raspberry Pi's.   </p>

<p>People who argue about Vim vs Emacs are both wrong. The answer is Sublime Text.</p>

<p>I worked at vivint.smart.home on streety.</p>

<p>I previously was employed by Canonical USA and I work on Juju and things related to www.jujucharms.com.</p>

<p>Before that, I worked at Arbor Networks on things related to ATLAS, which is now decommissioned.</p>

<p>From 1998 to 2008, I wrote custom software solutions for integrating Windows and Unix. My blend of traditional system administration and custom software solutions has allowed numerous enterprises to transcend platform dependence.</p>

<p>I have written software to manage specific applications deployed across hundreds of Unix servers and thousands of Windows servers remotely via a Web Management Interface. The system works without an agent utilizing standard Unix remote management protocols such as SSH.</p>

<p>I've been an independent contractor working on Windows Forms applications for tuning embedded software control modules for a US auto manufacturer.</p>

<p>I spend my free time writing more software, baking, and watching far too much television.</p>

<p>Baking is great. I highly recommend growing your own yeast.</p>

<p>All that is nice, but I should start at the beginning. I was born. I begged to be taught to read, but waited until formal school. Around age 6 - I’m not exactly sure when - I learned TRS-80 compatible basic on a Sharp 1500 (Radio Shack PC2) pocket computer. My parents encouraged this by borrowing a VIC20 from my uncle for a few months before purchasing the family an Atari 800XL for Christmas around the time I was 7 or 8.</p>

<p>Atari 800XL was WAY better than Commodore 64 in the only area that mattered to me: BASIC. I had drawing primitives. LINE, CIRCLE and PAINT functions - or were they called subroutines - were available. I loved me some drawing. In 1987 around the time I turned 10, my family upgraded to a used Amiga 1000, with the 512K option. Thanks to the AmigaBasic 1.2 and 1.3 provided by Microsoft, I was now writing basic without line numbers. This was like QBasic or QuickBasic on a PC available years later. I struggled endless hours trying to make the North C compiler compile my hello world app. I never succeeded.</p>

<h2>Main interests</h2>
<p>I really like programming and developing stuff. My main focus in web application development and testing. Among the technologies I am passionate about, you can find: <em>ASP.NET</em>, <em>.NET</em>, <em>C#</em>, <em>VB.NET</em>, <em>WCF</em>, <em>C/C++</em> (all hail Bjarne), <em>Boost C++ Library</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>Javascript</em> + dialects (<em>Typescript</em>, etc.), <em>HTML5</em>, CSS + dialects (<em>SASS</em>, <em>LESS</em>, etc.).</p>
<p>I have a lot of interests in Mathematics as well. Among engineering technologies, I really like working with: <a href=""http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wolfram Mathematica</a>, Wolfram Language, <a href=""http://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Matlab</a>.</p>
<p>I also like creating graphics, animations and presentation using the most popular applications in the <em>Adobe</em> families (I saw <em>Flash</em> growing since when it was still a baby, 5.0, and it was still <em>Macromedia</em>, RIP).</p>
<h2>(Human) Languages</h2>
<p>I like travelling a lot, and the best part of travelling is experiencing new languages, new sounds new people and culture. I actually love Asia. I lived in Japan and worked there. Made also a lot of friends and gonna return there soon (I hope). I can speak Italian, English, Japanese and still learning this fancy language called Danish.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>I also like sports. I practiced many but now I almost focused my entire life on <strong>swimming</strong> and <strong>open water swimming</strong>. Now I made a full transition to <strong>diving</strong> (no <em>scuba</em>!).</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>I also like photography, reading lots of books, food (strange food) and music. But most of all I like sharing knowledge with other people. More knowledge in the world means a better world! That's why I am #SOreadytohelp!</p>

<hr />
<p>I am a currently retired biostatistician and last worked at the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research where I worked on lab experiments, clinical trials and other medical research.  I have a PhD in Statistics from Stanford University.  I have published books on bootstrap and biostatistics and have written or coauthored many articles in statistics, mathematics and medical journals.  I am an ASA Fellow and have also been a member of ENAR, the IMS, the Bernoulli Society and the Royal Statistical Society. I like teaching and mentoring and doing puzzles (crossword, cryptograms and Sudoku) I used to play chess with my son Daniel but I am getting rusty at it as I age and he started beating me too often. I have been retired since 2012.  I was very active at CrossValidated in 2011, but have not contributed from 2012-2016. I resumed activity in November 2016 and am hoping to finish a few books I had abandoned and I hope to get back to doing some part time consulting at some point in the future.</p>

Professional programmers helping each other while learning.  Now I cannot ask a question without ""showing what I have done"" because ""people aren't here to do free work"".  I used to do ""free work"" and I enjoyed it - see my old answers below - but these days all people seem to care about is whether you are cheating at homework.  So I no longer participate here.</p>

<hr>

<p>I work on projects that mix computing and physics - I have a pile of experience as a software engineer, but my education, way back in the day, was as an astronomer.  It was research in astronomy that first took me to Chile, where I now live.  So I telecommute from Santiago, working with companies in the USA and UK.  Currently I'm part of a small team developing software related to geophysics - I guess you could call it a consultancy, but really we're just people that understand what you need and then - importantly! - make it.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite answers:</p>

<p><strong>Impatience</strong>: I'm too impatient to wait for my code to run so rewrite the code to improve performance. This makes people think I am a good programmer.</p>

<p><strong>Hubris</strong>: When someone asks if I can do something I just say Yes, then go find out how to do it (Google!). This makes people think I can do anything.</p>

I have been working full-time as a software engineer since I graduated from college in 2005. I began coding when I was 13, and I have loved it ever since. My main interest area is information security – or <em>cyber</em> if you prefer – and in addition to writing security software for a long time, I have also done some penetration testing work. In the last three years, I have been working as a contractor on a DARPA R&amp;D contract involving web crawling, dark web, and machine learning.</p>
<p>My main strength is developing web applications in high-level languages – Python is my favorite – but I consider myself more of a general hacker who is comfortable working with a wide range of technologies and learning whatever I need to accomplish the task at hand. (I suppose that <em>full-stack</em> is the trendy term.) In my study of infosec, I have spent a lot of time learning to read assembly and reverse engineer applications to develop exploits. (I have the OSCP, CISSP, and CEH certifications.)</p>
<p>I have released a couple of work projects as open source. I created an easy-to-use web crawler called <a href=""https://gitlab.com/hyperion-gray/starbelly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Starbelly</a>, as well as a database migrations system called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/agnostic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Agnostic</a>. And if you want to get really nerdy with me, I wrote a tiny utility called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sshadduser"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sshadduser</code></a> that simplifies the error-prone process of giving somebody SSH access to a server. I also like writing and teaching. In addition to developing infosec courses for government clients, I also participate here on Stack Overflow and infrequently publish on <a href=""https://markhaa.se"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my tech blog</a>.</p>
<p>I have been working full-time remote for several years now out of my home office in the Washington DC area. I am seeking contract work (1099) for 2018.</p>

Jay Cooke and Company, a large and respected banking house declares itself bankrupt, and announces its failure on September 18, 1873.. (The bank's collapse precipitates the ""Panic of 1873"" and the ensuing three yea depression during which more than 10,000 businesses fail.  
 
 The basic economic problems are overproduction, a declining market and deflation. Investors in Europe, where a depression is already underway, begin to call in American loans. The New York Stock Exchange closes its doors for 10 days; other businesses fail; and railroad construction is curtailed, with some railroads defaulting on their bonds. The unemployed begin to move about the country seeking jobs, and bread lines appear in the cities. The hard times drove numbers of laboring people and those in humble circumstances to the West and other portions of the country, to seek the rewards which the stagnation of business in the great commercial centre denied them.</p>

  If you want to become an expert programmer, google SOLID, buy GOF, buy POEAA, buy Clean Code, learn Refactoring, lookup GRASP, DDD, CQRS, DCI … but dont ask for PHP books. That's the most reasonable suggestion I can give you when you ask for Expert PHP books really.</p>

<p>The thing I enjoy the most is to describe complex systems with very simple abstract models. Here is a quote I like about abstractions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>""Pick the right ones, and programming will flow naturally from design;
    modules will have small and simple interfaces; and new functionality
    will more likely fit in without extensive reorganization. Pick the
    wrong ones, and programming will be a series of nasty surprises:
    interfaces will become baroque and clumsy as they are forced to
    accommodate unanticipated interactions, and even the simplest of
    changes will be hard to make.""</p>

<p>I am a computer scientist by training, which means I now think like one: always analysing,  abstracting, reducing, problem solving.</p>
<p>In addition, I picked up some affection and, hopefully, ability for actually building software over the years. You can take a look over on <a href=""https://github.com/reitzig"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Github</a>.</p>
<p>During my time at university I have found a passion for teaching, by which I mean helping people learn. Some say I was quite the nitpicker; it's for your best, I promise!</p>
<p>In my free time I play games, read books, code, work out, enjoy music, and roam the webs.</p>
